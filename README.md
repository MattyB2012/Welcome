# Matthew Boland | Assesment Task 1

## Personal Profile

My names Matt Boland, I’m 31 years old and have recently started my degree at RMIT (ID #s3197674, e: s3197674@student.rmit.edu.au).

Born and raised in Melbourne (except for a brief stint in New Zealand), I have two younger sisters and I am half Australian, half South African.
I’ve been in the fitness industry for over 10 years and have just started a career in IT.

My favourite sport is Basketball (by far!). I’ve been playing since I was 9 years old. 
Funnily enough that was also my first number!
I was lucky enough to go to New Zealand for a year to play and when I came back home I was playing for the Melbourne Tigers.

## Interest in IT

Ive always had an interest in IT, always excited and eager to hear/learn about what advancements are being developed. I have a particular interest in programming and design. After working with my uncle in graphic design I took a keen interest in the design elements of IT. 
RMIT was always the clear choice for me. 
I’ve had a number of friends study with RMIT and I was lucky to find the exact degree that I was looking for.
RMIT encourages forward thinking and promotes an environment of growth.


During my studies I expect to further my knowledge in Information Technology. I expect to develop a deep understanding and working knowledge that allows me to pursue a career in the field. I expect to be on the path to be an expert in my field.

# Personal Profile

### Results of an online Myers-Briggs test:

Defender Personality - ISFJ-A / ISFJ-T

### Results of an online learning style test:

Reflectors prefer to stand back and observe. They tend to be cautious, preferring to take a back seat. They like to collect and analyse information to help them reach their conclusions, which they may take considerable time and effort to develop. Reflectors see the big picture by using information gathered from previous experience as well as the here and now.

### Results of an leadership style assesment:

They say curiosity killed the cat but you recognize that is why cats have nine lives. Your relentless hunger to gain knowledge means you look far ahead while remaining cognizant of what is going on in the present. This ability to see gives you the confidence to take big risks. To gain the confidence and participation of others, you turn up the charm. However, you rarely need to be the center of attention. When the big risks pay off you share success with everyone who made it possible.

### What do the results of these tests mean for you?

The results of these tests allow me to better underhand how I am as a person. Having a greater understanding of my personality, learning style and leadership style allows me to work smarter and in ways which I am more responsive -  which allow me to accomplish my career aspirations.

### How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?

In a team environment knowing theses results will help me to work in a more constructive manner with my team members. Perhaps outlining these rustles to the team is an option to allow the best collaboration possible. Having a clear understanding of how I work learn and contribute best, will undoubtably help to sure the teams success.

### How should you take this into account when forming a team?

When forming a team, based on he results of these tests, it's important for me to recognise who “fits” - on both sides. Working with people (team) that compliment each other is very important to ensure success.

# Project Idea

### Overview 

My IT Project idea is to create and implement a health & wellness FAQ as a chatterbot, involving speech-to-text and text-to-speech software. The chatterbot will allow users to answer health related questions in a quick and efficient manner (speech) that can then be converted to text or text-to-speech

### Motivation 

In Australia alone, there are over 1.5million people using fitness apps. Most coaches, fitness trainers, fitness platforms, will require the client to fill out an initial questionnaire outline health goals, issues and relevant information required to produce their individual health program. Having the ability to utilise a chatterbot involving speech-to-text and text-to-speech software will enable an increased sustainability in this initial on-boarding phase in the program ( and potentially other elements within their wellness program).

### Description

A health & wellness FAQ as a chatterbot, involving speech-to-text and text-to-speech software would allow the ability for the initial health & wellness screening to be presented in speech-to-text or text-to-speech. Enabling the user to have the choice of how they complete the on-boarding phase, automatically creates a better user experience. The FAQ would then be stored in the app for both coach and client to refer to. The speech-to-text option would be utilised similar to a “voice message” (currently utilised on iOS) allowing for greater detail in the answers.
This software doesn’t have to to “stop” at the FAQ. The chatterbot & new software could also be used for delivering the program and general health & wellness advice. Enabling the client to listen and educate themselves on-the-go and then have the content converted to text.

### Tools and Technologies

GitHub could be utilised to program and develop the software. Majority of the fitness apps on the market will be able to accommodate this new software within their platform (similar to an add-on). Enabling the integration of similar software such as - Google speech-to-text or Microsoft Cognitive Services  ( plus this 			projects 	upgrades) would enable a far greater end to end user solution.

### Skills Required

For this project to come to life we need to develop software similar to that of Microsoft Cognitive Services - with the added ability to cross reference the clients answers with predetermined outcomes outlined in the FAQ. The only hardware that is required would be for the client to have access and a functional understanding of how to utilise the apps on a smart phone and or iPad ( or similar ) device.

### Outcome

If the project is successful, it will allow for far greater insights and accessibility in to clients and their health & wellness goals. Fitness applications will be able to implement the software into their existing platforms and allow them to expand their reach to new target markets. If the project is successful, and we are able to create and implement a health & wellness FAQ as a chatterbot, involving speech-to-text and text-to-speech software, it will allow us to transform the fitness industry and allow us to further enhance each clients experience.
