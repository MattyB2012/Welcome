## Personal Profile

My names Matt Boland, I’m 31 years old and have recently started my degree at RMIT (ID #s3197674, e: s3197674@student.rmit.edu.au).

Born and raised in Melbourne (except for a brief stint in New Zealand), I have two younger sisters and I am half Australian, half South African.
I’ve been in the fitness industry for over 10 years and have just started a career in IT.

My favourite sport is Basketball (by far!). I’ve been playing since I was 9 years old. 
Funnily enough that was also my first number!
I was lucky enough to go to New Zealand for a year to play and when I came back home I was playing for the Melbourne Tigers.
